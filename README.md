# Homework

This is a repository of code I wrote for my homework in [Tongji University](http://www.tongji.edu.cn/). Small programs are directly included in this repo, while larger projects are separated into independent repoes, and linked as submodules.

I would like to put all code inside this repo in the [public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain), so that it can be free for any one to use for any purpose.
